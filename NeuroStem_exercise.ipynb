    "1. How to configure Python so that it can analyse EEG data\n",

    "- Our Jupyter notebook is being run on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MostafaRahimiAzghadi/NeuroSTEM.git/HEAD?labpath=NeuroStem_exercise.ipynb), which is like a magic tool that turns your notebook into an easy-to-use website, allowing you to run and share your projects online hassle-free.\n",
